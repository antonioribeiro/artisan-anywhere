Artisan Anywhere
================

### TLDR;

This script will find artisan down the directory and execute it for you. So, running

`artisan migrate`

If you are up in the project tree, can be be equivalent to

`php ../../../../../../../../artisan migrate`

### Execute Artisan from anywhere in your Laravel project tree

Let's suppose you went for a walk, far down the Illuminate tree and, being in 

`/var/www/laravel/vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Database/Console/Migrations`, 

you need to run tinker, to test some stuff. Well... you have some options:

```
php ../../../../../../../../artisan tinker

php /var/www/laravel artisan tinker

cd /var/www/laravel ; php artisan tinker
```

or just

```
artisan tinker
```

What do you prefer?
