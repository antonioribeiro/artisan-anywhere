Laravel Artisan Anywhere
========================

### TLDR;

This script will recursively look for the artisan command down the directory tree and execute it for you, no matter where you are in the project tree.

## Installation

Install globally through composer

```bash
composer global require antonioribeiro/artisan-anywhere
```

Or download the raw file to your /usr/bin and make it executable

```bash
sudo wget -q -O /usr/local/bin/artisan \
 https://raw.github.com/antonioribeiro/artisan-anywhere/master/artisan

sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/artisan
```

or clone the repo and link it

```bash
sudo git clone https://github.com/antonioribeiro/artisan-anywhere.git /etc/laravel-anywhere

sudo ln -s /etc/laravel-anywhere/artisan.sh /usr/local/bin/artisan

sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/artisan
```


## Usage

Once installed, by running artisan from your project directory you should get

``` bash
$ artisan
Artisan found at /Users/antoniocarlosribeiro/code/pragmarx/pragmarx.com/artisan
Laravel Framework 5.5.28

Usage:
  command [options] [arguments]

...
```

#### Execute Artisan from anywhere in your Laravel project tree

Let's suppose you went for a walk, far down the Illuminate tree and, being in 

```
$ cd /var/www/laravel/vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Database/Console/Migrations
```

and you need to run tinker, to test some stuff. Well... you have some options:

```bash
php ../../../../../../../../artisan tinker

php /var/www/laravel artisan tinker

cd /var/www/laravel ; php artisan tinker
```

or just

```bash
artisan tinker
```
